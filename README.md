# Fed_ICPS

A Federated Learning framework for Industrial Cyber Physical Systems (ICPS), that uses Machine Learning techniques, including deep learning, transfer learning and federated learning. They are exploited on differents ICPS entities like Cloud, Fog, and Edge. 
The framework is deffined by 5 stages. The first is about the formalisation of the system, then the learning and transfer prtrained models between entities. Afterward, the election of the dynamic aggregator to aggregate the local models using Genetic Algorithms. Finally, the diffusion of the final model to the network.
